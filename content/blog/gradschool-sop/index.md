Don't just write a statement; make one.

> **Disclaimer**: I am no expert in admissions. This series of blog posts is a hastily organized braindump resulting from abundant introspection, and from discussions I've had over the last few years with prospective grad students. Much of this is _my view of the process_ and holds (if at all) only for North American PhD programs in ML/CV/Robotics.


**This post is for you if** you are writing a research statement / statement of purpose (SOP) for grad school applications.

> This is a very opiniated view on statements of purpose (SOPs). In this post I will NOT talk about *personal statements* which may be required for some schools.

For someone that's a grad student, I read a lot of SOPs every year. Over the last 6 months, I've read more than 50 statements (and helped edit nearly two-dozen). I often find myself giving the same piece of advice across most of these statements, so I thought *"why not save myself the time by curating the most frequent bits here"*? 

If you're wondering why I read so many statements, it's partly cause I help process internship/graduate applications at our group, and most mentees that [seek mentorship from me](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc5F-ZuxaeJn6W4oQKDvuItXE7OuV2s0s0vZXE1QB5EzizbwQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) are grad school applicants looking for a pair of eyes on their statements.

I often try and find a 20 or 30-minute block of time before reading a first-draft statement -- I usually have plenty of feedback, most of which is very similar across each statement I read. Over the years I've started curating canned responses/guidelines, and I will attempt to organize them in this post.

<!-- It is hard to come up with a generic recipe for _how to write a successful SOP_. If it were, I wouldn't have many mentees seek help with proofreading and editing statements of purpose. I will attempt to poing out a few things I've seen students do far too often -->

<!-- A generic recipe for writing statements is hard to deliver (and undesirable -- destroys creativity), I will attempt to discern various elements that help *make a statement count*. -->


## Be you

The first bit of trivial, yet essential advice: **be you**. Every statement is unique because it outlines *your* purpose. There's no point optimizing a statement to cater to your prospective reviewers or their interests. Be transparent -- this will allow your potential reviewers to assess your application's needs in the fairest manner possible. Do not feign interest in a particular research area or direction you have no intention in pursuing or just because it's trendy. People can usually tell these apart (particularly if you do not come off as having an in-depth understanding of the area).


## Your statement must convey purpose

A number of statements fail to convey the motivation behind pursuing a particular program. This is a crucial aspect of your SOP -- describe why you are interested in computer science in general, and your sub-field in particular. Reasons could be *goal-driven* (e.g. accelerating drug discovery using reinforcement learning) or *curiosity-driven* (e.g. why does stochastic gradient descent work so well for training neural nets) or something else. Stating them upfront provides reviewers with a pretext for everything that follows in your SOP. See [this tweet](https://twitter.com/kkitani/status/1339225283774308354?s=20) for an endorsement.


## Not a personal statement

> This is specifically for PhD programs

A common pattern I've seen with most SOPs I've read is that they tend to talk a lot about personal traits and qualities. Plenty of statements go on and on about how an applicant thinks they're the most diligent and creative person ever, or about how someone worked very hard to accomplish their goals. Such statements--in my view--suffer a **credibility problem**: the applicant has incentive to brag or exaggerate. Rather, you could let the other parts of your application package (your letters or personal statement or CV) establish personal traits (letter writers do not suffer the aforementioned credibility problem). It helps to think of your SOP as a mini research proposal. Talk about why your research direction is important and exciting. Imagine you were successful; what kind of new applications would then be enabled?
<!-- Such mentions of personal traits and characteristics are also qualitative: you might always rank yourself to be the most hardworking person you've ever met. If your statement rather focused on facts (scientific or otherwise) and if it talked almost entirely about your past/proposed research, ... -->


## Avoid cliche

At this point I've just lost count of the number of SOPs that start with a childhood anecdote having to do with science fairs or robot competitions or TV shows. As aptly summed up by Kris in this Tweet thread, ["Please don't start your SOP with the word Ureka!"](https://twitter.com/kkitani/status/1334307658426445825?s=20)


## Generic-Specific-Generic

A good design idea for research statements is what I call the generic-specific-generic scheme. Begin with a somewhat broad characterization of your interests (Hypothetical example: *My research interests are broadly along the intersections of deep learning and geometry processing, particularly on ...*). Do not be too broad (Hypothetical example: *My research interests include deep learning and computer vision*). Once you have characterized your interests, deep dive into a few specific projects and proposed directions. I have seen many good SOPs devote equal space for past and future research. Towards the end, it's a good idea to present a big-picture overview of your vision and the applications and/or insights your research might unlock.


## Think about the full application package

Most students write their SOP as if it were an independent document; few contextualize it with respect to their application materials. You can use your SOP to talk about things that aren't necessarily on your CV (reasons for poor grade in a few courses, career interruptions due to personal/family reasons). Some universities require personal statements in which case that's the best place for these discussions. Alternatively, if you have too many projects to talk about and too little space in your SOP, consider asking one of your letter writers to discuss a project in greater detail. A common mistake people tend to make is to treat the SOP as a verbose form of their CV. Remember that admissions committees always look at your CV.


## Do your homework

Please, please, do your homework! A number of statements end up listing faculty that have either retired or aren't taking on students in the application cycle. Ensure that you list faculty who are actively hiring. Another related trend I have noticed is most SOPs end up listing the top (most sought-after) 3-4 faculty at a school, without actually sensing a research fit. It is important to ensure that you [pick your prospective advisors wisely](http://krrish94.github.io/blog/gradschool-pick-school/). Merely going after the top-k advisors implies stiffer competition and hence lower likelihood in receiving an offer. On an unrelated but serious note, please get all the names of your prospective advisors, labs, and schools right. I still receive so many applications to **MILA**, even after it has been a couple years since its renaming :)


## Personalize

This is the aspect of a SOP that's the hardest to get right. Personalize your statement to the school and program you are applying for. Many statements merely list 2-3 influential papers per faculty by peeking at their Google Scholar profile. It is important to asses whether your prospective advisors are still actively working in the area. What's more important is to get a sense of your prospective advisor's viewpoints about areas of your interest. With most talks being online and publicly accessible these days, it isn't hard to get hold of a talk by your potential advisors. Look out for anything that might convey their thoughts on a particular problem. Pay great detail to the Q&A during and after the talk. Gauge if these resonate with (or conflict) your views, and list them in your SOP.


## Little things

With nearly all SOPs read on digital screens and readers, there's plenty of little things you can do to make your SOP more readable. Hyperlink anything that can be hyperlinked -- people/schools/labs/companies you've worked with, project pages, manuscripts, videos showcasing your work, media coverage; these are all great ways to supplement your statement. If you use colored text, images, or plots, ensure that your palettes are colorblind-friendly.


## Explicit structure

When people often read two-page-long statements it is hard to remember each point conveyed along the way. It helps if your statement is organized into explicit sections and subsections -- this way the reader can skim and get a sense of all the themes being discussed.


## Edit, re-edit, re-(re-)edit

That's it! The single most important takeaway of this post. As with any piece of scientific writing, take as many passes of the document as you can before you send it out for review or submit it. Get as many of your friends/mentees to review it as possible. It is important that your SOP is readable by people outside of your primary research area. This improves the chances of the SOP appealing to a larger fraction of prospective advisors.

Drafting and continuously editing out statements can be daunting and/or stressful. However, remember that the end result is worth the effort. I personally draw immense satisfaction from watching SOPs evolve over time; reminiscing Dorothy Parker's quote **"I hate writing, I love having written"**.

> Finally, remember that each school and review committee has different expectations from a statement of purpose. It is best to get each of your statements reviewed by students at the school it is geared towards.
