abstract: f-Cal is calibration method for probabilistic regression networks. Typical Bayesian neural networks are overconfident in their predictions. For these predictions to be used in downstream tasks, reliable and calibrated uncertainity estimates are critical. f-Cal proposes a simple loss function to remedy this; this can be employed to train any probabilistic neural regressor to produced calibrated estimates of aleatoric uncertainty.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We present a simple approach that uses a variational loss to enforce calibration in probabilistic regression networks.
