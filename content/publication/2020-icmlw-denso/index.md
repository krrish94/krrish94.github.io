abstract: â€” Deep neural networks are the de-facto standard for object detection in autonomous driving applications. However, neural networks cannot be blindly trusted even within the training data distribution, let alone outside it. This has paved way for several probabilistic object detection techniques that measure uncertainty in the outputs of an object detector. Through this position paper, we serve three main purposes. First, we briefly sketch the landscape of current methods for probabilistic object detecion. Second, we present the main shortcomings of these approaches. Finally, we present promising avenues for future research, and proof-of-concept results where applicable. Through this effort, we hope to bring the community one step closer to performing accurate, reliable, and consistent probabilistic object detection.


# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
