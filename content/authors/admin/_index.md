I am a PhD student at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) and the [Robotics and Embodied AI Lab](http://montrealrobotics.ca/), advised by [Liam Paull](http://liampaull.ca/). My [research](#publications) strives to develop embodied agents that perceive, reason, and act intelligently. I aim to leverage our deep understanding of the _rules of the world_ (physics, _classical_ robotics, vision, graphics) to support modern deep learning machinery.

I'm fortunate to actively collaborate on projects with [Derek Nowrouzezahrai](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~derek/)'s group at [McGill](http://www.mcgill.ca/), [Sanja Fidler](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fidler/)'s [group](https://nv-tlabs.github.io/) at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/), and [Madhava Krishna](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/)'s group at [IIIT Hyderabad](http://iiit.ac.in/).I am always interested to connect with people that share similar thoughts or research interests (drop me a line at `<my-twitter-handle>@gmail.com`). At [REAL](http://montrealrobotics.ca/) and [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en), we have limited open spots for motivated interns with a strong background (please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/BB5csPfhZ7zUEEgg9) if that's you).

##### Pro-bono office hours

I've committed to set aside 2 hours a week, for mentoring underrepresented groups in robotics, computer vision, and deep learning. If this is you, and you'd like to branstorm or seek feedback on research, grad school apps, or anything else, please [fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc5F-ZuxaeJn6W4oQKDvuItXE7OuV2s0s0vZXE1QB5EzizbwQ/viewform?usp=sf_link).
