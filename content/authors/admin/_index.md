I am a PhD student at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) and the [Robotics and Embodied AI Lab](http://montrealrobotics.ca/), advised by [Liam Paull](http://liampaull.ca/). My research strives to develop embodied agents that can perceive, reason, and act intelligently. Central to my research is the idea that we should leverage our deep understanding of the _rules of the world_ (physics, _classical_ robotics/vision/graphics) to support modern deep learning machinery. I spend a fair bit of my time [contributing to](https://github.com/krrish94/) open-source software.

I am always interested to connect with people that share similar thoughts or research interests. Drop me a line at `<my-twitter-handle>@gmail.com` if that's you. I also have open spots for interns with a strong background in my areas of interest (please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/BB5csPfhZ7zUEEgg9) if you'd like to work with us at [REAL](http://montrealrobotics.ca/) and [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en)).
