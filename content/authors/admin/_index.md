I am a postdoctoral associate at [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) with [Josh Tenenbaum](http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/josh.html) and [Antonio Torralba](https://web.mit.edu/torralba/www/). I earned my PhD ([see thesis](files/Jatavallabhula_Krishna_Murthy_2022_these.pdf)) at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) and the [Robotics and Embodied AI Lab](http://montrealrobotics.ca/), advised by [Liam Paull](http://liampaull.ca/).

My [research](#publications) centers around building **invertible world models** --- representations that encode how the world works. These world models enable the design of intelligent systems that perceive, reason, and act. My research spans several areas including robotics, computer vision, computer graphics; and intertwines our _understanding of the world_ with deep learning.

My work has been recognized with PhD fellowship awards from NVIDIA and Google, and a best-paper award from IEEE RAL.


<!-- I'm fortunate to have closely worked with [Florian Shkurti](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~florian/), [Derek Nowrouzezahrai](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~derek/), [Sanja Fidler](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fidler/), and other excellent researchers. -->

<!-- My PhD is supported by an [**NVIDIA graduate fellowship**](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/12/04/graduate-fellowships-gpu-computing-research/). An early-preview of [my PhD dissertation is available here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-5YlECag4PrdQCgGirPThZOCOY7FiyDm/view?usp=sharing). -->
