I am a PhD candidate at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) and the [Robotics and Embodied AI Lab](http://montrealrobotics.ca/), advised by [Liam Paull](http://liampaull.ca/). My [research](#publications) vision is to enable embodied agents to perceive, reason, and act intelligently. To achieve this, my work intertwines our _understanding of the world_ (physics, robotics, vision, graphics) with deep learning machinery.

I'm fortunate to actively collaborate with [Florian Shkurti](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~florian/), [Derek Nowrouzezahrai](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~derek/), [Sanja Fidler](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fidler/), and other excellent researchers.

My research is supported by an [**NVIDIA graduate fellowship**](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/12/04/graduate-fellowships-gpu-computing-research/).

I also spent the summer of 2021 working with [Animesh Garg](https://animesh.garg.tech/), [Fabio Ramos](https://fabioramos.github.io/Home.html), and [Dieter Fox](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~fox/) at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/).

> ##### Pro-bono office hours
> I commit 2 hours a week to mentor underrepresented groups in robotics, computer vision, and machine learning. If this is you, and you'd like to discuss research, grad school apps/advice, or anything else, please [fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc5F-ZuxaeJn6W4oQKDvuItXE7OuV2s0s0vZXE1QB5EzizbwQ/viewform?usp=sf_link).
