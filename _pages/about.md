I am a postdoc at [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) with [Josh Tenenbaum](http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/josh.html) and [Antonio Torralba](https://web.mit.edu/torralba/www/). I received my PhD at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/), advised by [Liam Paull](http://liampaull.ca/).

My goal is to design intelligent agents that effortlessly *perceive*, *reason about*, and *act in* the world around them. While this is seemingly trivial for humans, it is currently impossible for modern AI systems. My research takes steps to bridge this gap by drawing ideas from robotics, computer vision, graphics, and computational cognitive science; intertwining our understanding of the world with probabilistic inference and deep learning machinery.

My work has been recognized with PhD fellowship awards from NVIDIA and Google, and a best-paper award from IEEE RAL.
