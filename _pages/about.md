I am an AI research scientist at [Meta](https://ai.meta.com/research/). Previously, I was a postdoc at [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) with [Antonio Torralba](https://web.mit.edu/torralba/www/) and [Josh Tenenbaum](http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/josh.html). Prior to that, I received my PhD at [Universite de Montreal](https://www.umontreal.ca/) and [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/), advised by [Liam Paull](http://liampaull.ca/).

My research focuses on building _world models for robots_ and other physical agents to enable them to perceive, reason, and act just as humans are able. My work spans the robotics, computer vision, and machine learning communities.

My work has been recognized with PhD fellowship awards from NVIDIA and Google, and a best-paper award from IEEE RAL.
