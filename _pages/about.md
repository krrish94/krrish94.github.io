I am a postdoc at [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) with [Josh Tenenbaum](http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/josh.html) and [Antonio Torralba](https://web.mit.edu/torralba/www/). I received my PhD at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/), advised by [Liam Paull](http://liampaull.ca/).

My research focuses on designing _structured world models for robots_: rich, multisensory models of the world that best leverage our understanding of real-world phenomena such as physics, graphics, and multisensory integration. I am interested in understanding and building computational abstractions that best enable robots and embodied AI systems to perceive, reason, and act in the real-world. My work draws upon ideas from robotics, computer vision, graphics, and computational cognitive science; intertwining our understanding of the world with probabilistic inference and deep learning.

My work has been recognized with PhD fellowship awards from NVIDIA and Google, and a best-paper award from IEEE RAL.
