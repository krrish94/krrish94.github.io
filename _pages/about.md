I am a postdoc at [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) with [Josh Tenenbaum](http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/josh.html) and [Antonio Torralba](https://web.mit.edu/torralba/www/). I received my PhD at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/), advised by [Liam Paull](http://liampaull.ca/).

My goal is to design intelligent agents that leverage *invertible world models* to multimodally perceive, reason about, and act in the world around them. This is seemingly trivial for humans, but currently impossible for AI systems. My research takes steps to bridge this gap by drawing ideas from robotics, computer vision, graphics, and computational cognitive science; intertwining our understanding of the world with probabilistic inference and deep learning.

My work has been recognized with PhD fellowship awards from NVIDIA and Google, and a best-paper award from IEEE RAL.
